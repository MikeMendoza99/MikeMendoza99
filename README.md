# 🌙 DreamLoop

> *An interactive experience focused on winding down, nighttime routines, and gentle expression.*

## 🛏️ About the project

**DreamLoop** is a soft-core digital space built around the concept of rest, reflection, and peaceful connection. Designed to be low-pressure and emotionally safe, it's not your average "game."

**It's not a life sim. Not a clicker. Not a sandbox.**  
It's a pocket of peace — made to be visited, not conquered.

## 🧠 Current Status

- 🔒 Concept design phase
- 💭 Worldbuilding and tone-setting in progress
- 🧩 Early prototypes (navigation & character interaction)
- 🛠️ Built in Unreal Engine (testing scene architecture & animation logic)
- 🎨 Art direction locked (soft pastels, minimal UI, ambient lighting)

## 🪄 Core Vibes

- A non-intrusive, cozy loop — with no grind
- Customization that feels expressive, not competitive
- Special events without FOMO or urgency
- Lo-fi aesthetics designed to invite calm and comfort
